    "Mistral Large 2 now offers a native JSON output mode. This feature allows developers to receive the model's responses in a structured, easy-to-read format that can be readily integrated into various applications and systems. With JSON being a widely adopted data exchange standard, this capability simplifies the process of working with the model's outputs, making it more accessible and practical for developers across different domains and use cases. \n",

    "1. Entity Extraction Phase from Raw Text for Building Knowledge Graphs for Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)\n",
    "- Because it represents a trending pattern in retrieval augmented generation, where structured knowledge graphs enhance contextual understanding. \n",
    "- Automating the graph modeling process from raw text is essential yet often complex, and Mistral Large 2's native JSON output simplifies this by efficiently structuring extracted entities and relationships.\n",

    "## Entity Extraction Phase from Raw Text\n",
    "\n",
    "Entity extraction is the process of identifying and extracting relevant entities (e.g., people, organizations, locations, dates, etc.) from raw text input. This capability is crucial in various natural language processing (NLP) tasks and applications, such as information retrieval, knowledge graph construction, and question answering systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "By leveraging Mistral Large 2's JSON output mode, developers can receive the extracted entities in a structured JSON format, making it easier to process and integrate them into downstream applications or pipelines.\n",
    "\n",
    "One notable example where entity extraction plays a vital role is in Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). In this technique, the extracted entities serve as the initial seed for querying external knowledge sources, such as knowledge graphs or databases, to retrieve additional information and augment the language model's knowledge. The structured JSON output from the entity extraction phase can be seamlessly ingested into the RAG pipeline, facilitating the construction or updating of knowledge graphs from raw text input."

    "The history of the Internet and the World Wide Web:\n",
    "\n",
    "The Internet and the World Wide Web have revolutionized the way we communicate, access information, and conduct business. The origins of the Internet can be traced back to the 1960s when the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA), a branch of the United States Department of Defense, initiated a research program to develop a decentralized communication network capable of withstanding potential nuclear attacks.\n",
    "\n",
    "This research led to the creation of ARPANET, the precursor to the modern Internet. Initially, ARPANET connected a few universities and research centers, allowing researchers to share data and resources. Over time, more institutions joined the network, and the concept of interconnecting networks emerged, laying the foundation for the Internet as we know it today.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the 1970s and 1980s, the Internet continued to evolve, with the development of key technologies such as the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP), which standardized the way data is transmitted over the network. During this period, the Internet remained primarily a tool for researchers and academics.\n",
    "\n",
    "The true revolution came in 1989 when Tim Berners-Lee, a computer scientist at CERN (the European Organization for Nuclear Research), proposed the idea of the World Wide Web. Berners-Lee envisioned a system that would allow researchers to easily share and access information across the Internet. He developed the first web browser, server, and the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), which enabled the retrieval and display of hypertext documents on the Internet.\n",
    "\n",
    "The World Wide Web quickly gained popularity, and in 1993, Marc Andreessen and his team at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) released Mosaic, the first widely-used graphical web browser. This user-friendly interface made the Web accessible to a broader audience, sparking a surge in Internet adoption and usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the Internet and the Web grew, various companies and organizations emerged to provide services and infrastructure. Internet Service Providers (ISPs) facilitated access to the Internet for individuals and businesses, while web hosting companies offered platforms for hosting websites and web applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "The rise of e-commerce in the late 1990s further accelerated the growth of the Internet and the Web. Companies like Amazon, eBay, and others pioneered online shopping and digital marketplaces, transforming the way we buy and sell goods and services.\n",
    "\n",
    "Today, the Internet and the World Wide Web have become integral parts of our daily lives. Social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram have revolutionized how we connect and share information. Online streaming services like Netflix and YouTube have disrupted traditional media and entertainment industries. Cloud computing and software-as-a-service (SaaS) models have transformed the way businesses operate and deliver services.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite the immense progress and innovation, the Internet and the Web continue to evolve, driven by emerging technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence, and blockchain. As we look to the future, these technologies promise to further revolutionize the way we live, work, and interact with the digital world.\n",
