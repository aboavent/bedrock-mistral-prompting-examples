    "[Codestral](https://mistral.ai/news/codestral/) is an open-weight generative AI model explicitly designed for code generation tasks. It helps developers write and interact with code through a shared instruction and completion API endpoint. As it masters code and English, it can be used to design advanced AI applications for software developers. Codestral is trained on a diverse dataset of 80+ programming languages, including the most popular ones, such as Python, Java, C, C++, JavaScript, and Bash. It also performs well on more specific ones like Swift and Fortran. This broad language base ensures Codestral can assist developers in various coding environments and projects.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "As a 22B model, Codestral sets a new standard on the performance/latency space for code generation compared to previous models used for coding. With its larger context window of 32k (compared to 4k, 8k or 16k for competitors), Codestral outperforms all other models in RepoBench, a long-range eval for code generation.\n",

    "In this notebook, you will learn how to deploy the [mistralai/Codestral-v0.1](https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Codestral-22B-v0.1) model to [Amazon SageMaker](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/) and perform inference. We will utilize the Hugging Face LLM DLC, a purpose-built Inference Container designed to facilitate the deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) in a secure and managed environment. This Deep Learning Container (DLC) is powered by <b>Text Generation Inference (TGI)</b>, a scalable and optimized solution for deploying and serving LLMs efficiently. Additionally, you are also able to use the <b>Language Model Inference (LMI)</b> container as an alternative DLC within this notebook. LMIs are specialized Docker containers for LLM inference, provided by AWS. With these containers, you can leverage high performance open-source inference libraries like vLLM, TensorRT-LLM, Transformers NeuronX to deploy LLMs on AWS SageMaker Endpoints. Detailed instance requirements for various model sizes will also be provided to ensure optimal deployment configurations.  \n",

      "<s> [INST] Design and implement a lock-free, wait-free concurrent hash table in C++ using atomic operations. Ensure that it scales well with multiple threads and discuss how you would handle ABA problems and memory reclamation. [/INST]\n",
      "\n",
      "Designing a lock-free, wait-free concurrent hash table in C++ using atomic operations is a complex task. Here's a high-level design:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Data Structure**: Use a hash table where each bucket contains a linked list of key-value pairs. Each node in the linked list will contain the key, value, and a pointer to the next node.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Atomic Operations**: Use atomic operations to ensure thread safety. For example, when inserting a new node, use atomic compare-and-swap (CAS) to update the next pointer of the new node. When deleting a node, use atomic load and store to update the next pointer of the previous node.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Scalability**: To ensure scalability, use a resizing mechanism. When the number of elements in the hash table exceeds a certain threshold, create a new hash table with double the size and rehash all the elements from the old table to the new table. Use a technique called \"double hashing\" or \"cuckoo hashing\" to minimize the number of elements that need to be rehashed.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **ABA Problem**: To handle the ABA problem, use a version number or timestamp for each node. When a thread wants to delete a node, it first checks the version number of the node. If the version number has not changed, it proceeds with the deletion. If the version number has changed, it means that the node has been reinserted, so the deletion is aborted.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Memory Reclamation**: For memory reclamation, use a garbage collection mechanism. One approach is to use a reference counting scheme. Each thread that accesses a node increments its reference count. When a thread no longer needs a node, it decrements its reference count. When the reference count of a node drops to zero, it means that the node is no longer in use, so it can be safely deallocated.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's a pseudo-code implementation of the above design:\n",

      "```cpp\n",
      "class Node {\n",

      "        // find the node with the given key\n",

By leveraging the power of Text Generation Inference (TGI), we've demonstrated how to efficiently deploy and serve this large language model in a secure, managed environment.\n",

The integration with a Gradio application further illustrates the practical application of this deployment, enabling interactive and user-friendly access to the model's capabilities.\n",
