    "[Mixtral-8x7B](https://mistral.ai/news/mixtral-of-experts/) is a foundation model developed by Mistral AI, supporting English, French, German, Italian, and Spanish text, with code generation abilities. It supports a variety of use cases such as text summarization, classification, text completion, and code completion. It behaves well in chat mode. To demonstrate the straightforward customizability of the model, Mistral AI has also released a Mixtral-8x7B-instruct model for chat use cases, fine-tuned using a variety of publicly available conversation datasets. Mixtral models have a large context length of up to 32,000 tokens.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we combine the strengths of two powerful tools: [DJL](https://docs.djl.ai/) (Deep Java Library) for the serving framework and [TensorRT-LLM](https://nvidia.github.io/TensorRT-LLM/) for distributed large language model inference on Nvidia. DJLServing, a high-performance universal model serving solution powered by DJL, handles the overall serving architecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our setup, vLLM handles the core LLM inference tasks, leveraging its optimizations to achieve high performance and low latency. DJLServing manages the broader serving infrastructure, handling incoming requests, load balancing, and coordinating with vLLM for efficient inference.\n",
    "\n",
    "This combination allows us to deploy the `Mixtral 8x7B` model across GPUs on the `ml.p5.48xlarge` instance with optimal resource utilization. vLLM's efficiencies in memory management and request handling enable us to serve this large model with improved throughput compared to traditional serving methods. To learn more about DJL, DJLServing, and TensorRT-LLM you can refer to this [blog post](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/boost-inference-performance-for-llms-with-new-amazon-sagemaker-containers/).\n",

    "Here is a list of settings that we use in this configuration file:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `HF_MODEL_ID`: The model id of a pretrained model hosted inside a model repository on [huggingface.co](https://huggingface.co/models). The container uses this model id to download the corresponding model repository on huggingface.co. This is an optional setting and is not needed in the scenario where you are brining your own model. If you are getting your own model, you can include the URI of the Amazon S3 bucket that contains the model.\n",
    "- `HF_TOKEN`: Some models on the HuggingFace Hub are gated and require permission from the owner to access. To deploy a gated model from the HuggingFace Hub using LMI, you must provide an [Access Token](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/security-tokens) via this environment variable.\n",
    "- `OPTION_ENGINE`: The engine for DJL to use. In this case, we intend to use [MPI](https://docs.djl.ai/docs/serving/serving/docs/lmi/conceptual_guide/lmi_engine.html). MPI is used to operate on single machine multi-gpu or multiple machines multi-gpu use cases.\n",
    "- `OPTION_DTYPE`: The data type you plan to cast the model weights to. If not provided, LMI will use fp16.\n",
    "- `OPTION_TGI_COMPAT`: To get the same response output as HuggingFace's Text Generation Inference, you can use the env `OPTION_TGI_COMPAT=true`.\n",
    "- `OPTION_TASK`: The task used in Hugging Face for different pipelines. Default is text-generation. For further reading on DJL parameters on SageMaker, follow the [link](https://docs.djl.ai/docs/serving/serving/docs/lmi/user_guides/deepspeed_user_guide.html)\n",
    "- `OPTION_ROLLING_BATCH`: Enables continuous batching (iteration level batching) with one of the supported backends. Available backends differ by container, see [Inference Library Configurations](https://docs.djl.ai/docs/serving/serving/docs/lmi/deployment_guide/configurations.html#inference-library-configuration) for mappings.\n",
    "    - In the TensorRT-LLM Container:\n",
    "        - use `OPTION_ROLLING_BATCH=trtllm` to use TensorRT-LLM (this is the default)\n",
    "- `TENSOR_PARALLEL_DEGREE`: Set to the number of GPU devices over which DeepSpeed needs to partition the model. This parameter also controls the no of workers per model which will be started up when DJL serving runs. Setting this to `max`, which will shard the model across all available GPUs. As an example if we have a 8 GPU machine and we are creating 8 partitions then we will have 1 worker per model to serve the requests.\n",
    "- `OPTION_MAX_INPUT_LEN`: Maximum input token size you expect the model to have per request. This is a compilation parameter that set to the model for Just-in-Time compilation. If you set this value too low, the model will unable to consume the long input. LMI also validates this at runtime for each request.\n",
    "- `OPTION_MAX_OUTPUT_LEN`: Maximum output token size you expect the model to have per request. This is a compilation parameter that set to the model for Just-in-Time compilation. If you set this value too low, the model will unable to produce tokens beyond the value you set.\n",
    "- `OPTION_TRUST_REMOTE_CODE`: If the model artifacts contain custom modeling code, you should set this to true after validating the custom code is not malicious. If you are using a HuggingFace Hub model id, you should also specify HF_REVISION to ensure you are using artifacts and code that you have validated.\n",
